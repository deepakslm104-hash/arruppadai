<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
Arruppadai is a Unicode-native digital epigraphy platform focused on the
encoding, representation, and scholarly use of <strong>Tamil-Brahmi</strong>
inscriptions. The project prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and long-term
digital preservation over visual approximation or font-specific rendering.
</p>

<p>
This repository serves as a foundational release, establishing a minimal,
standards-compliant base upon which tools for transcription, comparison,
annotation, and publication can be built.
</p>

<h2>Unicode Commitment</h2>
<p>
Arruppadai strictly adheres to the official Unicode encoding for the
Brahmi script block (<code>U+11000–U+1107F</code>), including Tamil-Brahmi
variants as encoded by the Unicode Consortium.
</p>

<p>
All textual representations in this project are stored and processed as
Unicode code points rather than glyph substitutions or private-use mappings.
This ensures interoperability across platforms, future-proofing, and
scholarly verifiability.
</p>

<p>
No legacy fonts, image-based encodings, or non-standard transliteration-only
representations are used as authoritative data.
</p>

<h2>Scholarly Intent</h2>
<p>
Arruppadai is designed to support academic and research use cases, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digital epigraphy and inscriptional studies</li>
  <li>Historical linguistics and script evolution research</li>
  <li>Unicode-based textual analysis</li>
  <li>Reproducible citation and digital publication</li>
</ul>

<p>
The project does not attempt to impose interpretive readings or linguistic
reconstructions. Instead, it provides a neutral, standards-aligned digital
substrate upon which such work may be conducted.
